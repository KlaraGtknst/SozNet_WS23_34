    "### Generation of Graphs for given Degree Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we present two slightly different algorithms;\n",
    "one constructs a graph with a *sparse core*, the other constructs a graph with a *dense core*.\n",
    "We assume that the sum of all degrees is more then $2(n-1)$ where n is the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both algorithms we need a subroutine called `connectivity`. This subroutine first of all checks wheter the constructed graph is connected. \n",
    "If the graph $G$ is not connected, it finds a connected component that contains a cycle. A cycle is a walk of length at least 3 where the starting and end point coincide and the corresponding sequence of traversed edges consists only of pairwise different edges.\n",
    "Such a connected component must exist because of the assumption on the degrees made above.\n",
    "Let $uv$ be an edge in the cylce, and $st$ be an edge in another connected component.\n",
    "We now delete edges $uv$ and $st$, and insert edges $us$ and $vt$ to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sparse Core.*\n",
    "In this section we describe an algorithm that constructs a graph with a given degree sequence that additionally is sparse. \n",
    "We are given a degree sequence $d_1 \\geq d_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq d_n$, and we assign the vertices $v_1, v_2,\\ldots,v_n$ to those degrees.\n",
    "As long as there exists a vertex $v_i$ with $d_i>0$, we choose the vertex $v_l$ with the currently lowest degree $d_l$.\n",
    "Then we insert $d_l$ edges from $v_l$ to the first $d_l$ vertices with highest degree.\n",
    "After that we update the residual vertex degrees $d_i = d_i-1$ for $i=1,\\ldots,d_l$ and $d_l=0$.\n",
    "Last,but not least, we have to check connectivity and, if necessary, establish it using the above mentioned method `connectivity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dense Core.*\n",
    "To construct a graph with a dense core for a certain degree sequence, we only have to change the above algorithm for sparse cores slightly.\n",
    "As long as there exists a vertex $v_i$ with $d_i>0$ we now choose such a vertex arbitrarily and insert edges from $v_i$ to the $d_i$ vertices with the highest residual degrees.\n",
    "After that we only have to update the residual degrees and establish connectivity if it is not given.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercise 1\n",
    "Read the above text and implement the three methods `connectivity`, `sparse_core` and `dense_core` accordingly.\n",
    "Comment your code properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints\n",
    "* Submit your code zipped via [moodle](https://moodle.uni-kassel.de/course/view.php?id=11038) until 17.11.2023 23:55 MEZ\n",
    "* Use the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/) library.\n",
    "* Below the Implementation section is a Test section with three degree sequences that can be used to check your code.\n"
