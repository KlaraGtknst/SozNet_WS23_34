    "\n",
    "In graph theory cliques, i.e., subsets of the graph such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent, are one of the basic concepts of interest.\n",
    "The concept has found a lot of applications throughout different disciplines.\n",
    "For example in social network analysis cliques are used to analyze and model communities and in electrical engineering to analyze the topology of communication networks.\n",
    "Further there are a lot of applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.\n",
    "A directly connected task is the finding of cliques.\n",
    "This so called clique problem is computationally hard.\n",
    "Nonetheless a multitude of algorithms have been developed.\n",
    "In 1977 Tsukiyama et. al. showed that it is possible to compute all maximal cliques where the amount of time per generated clique is polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Task is to implement their algorithm."

As a reference: Your implementation should compute the maximal cliques of the biggest subgraph (300 nodes) in under 400 seconds when timing the computation using the cProfile library.\n",
