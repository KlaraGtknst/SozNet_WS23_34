    "### Small World Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Small-world networks were introduced by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz in a paper in *Nature* in 1998. \n",
    "They are linked to the small world phenomenon, that describes the property of social networks to have small average path lengths. Additionally Watts and Strogatz observed that there are networks where the neighborhood of every node is densly connected, a property that random networks usually do not exhibit.\n",
    "In their paper they investigated this phenomenon and coined the term small-world networks.\n",
    "The paper is supplied together with the jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Graph $(V,E)$ the **average shortest path** ($ASP$) in a Graph is defined by $ASP := \\sum_{u,v\\in V}\\frac{d(u,v)}{|V|(|V|-1)}$ where $d(u,v)$ is the shortest path from $u$ to $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **local clustering coefficient** of a node in an undirected graph $C_i$ for $i\\in V$ is defined by the ratio of edges in the neighborhood of $i$ compared to the number of possible edges, i.e., $C_i := \\frac{2|\\{e_{jk}: v_j,v_k \\in N_i, e_{jk} \\in E\\}|}{|N_i|(|N_i|-1)}$ where $N_i$ is the neighborhood of the node $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: $|N_i|(|N_i|-1)/2$ is the number of edges in a fully connected neighborhood, i.e., if the neighborhood would form a complete subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **average local clustering coefficient** ($ALCC$) is defined as the average over all local clustering coefficients, i.e., $ ALCC := \\frac{1}{|V|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|V|} C_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a small world network is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A network is called a **small-world network** if its average shortest path ($ASP$) is small and after the networks edges have pairwise been randomized (typically around $100\\cdot |E|$ times) the $ASP$ remains nearly unchanged but the average local clustering coefficient ($ALCC$) breakes down, i.e., $$ASP_{actual} \\approx APS_{randomized}$$ and $$ALCC_{actual} \\gg ALCC_{randomized}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: For small-world social networks an $ASP\\leq 4$ and an $ALCC\\geq 70\\%$ are common, for other networks, e.g., the ones mentioned in the paper, smaller $ALCC$ values and larger $ASP$ values are also normal. The important part is the breaking down of the $ALCC$ when comparing to a randomized network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edge Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "The **edge randomization** should choose two edges uniformly at random from the edge set and swap nodes, e.g., edges $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ swap nodes and become $(a,d)$ and $(c,b)$. The method should keep the node degrees intact.\n",
    "To achive this it must be checked whether the edges have common nodes and whether the edges that would be generated through swapping already exist.\n"
